0A: Steve: I am Steve Jobs. I am busy turning a
    profit in heaven, what do you want from me?
    Bum Mook Oh made, so if you think I am buggy,
    shoot an email to bmo5@uw.edu.

0B: Ieve: Crikey Mate! Ma name's Ieve Sterwin; I was created by Arvindram Krishnamoorthy.
          You can contact him at karvi90@uw.edu but for now: 
          Which data structure or algorithm do ya wanna know about?

1A: Steve: Dude, I invented the friggin iPhone. Have you heard of it?

1B: Ieve: I'm a simple bloke, I dunno about no iPhone.

2A: Steve: I love your negativity.

2B: Ieve: Yeah, ain't that runtime a beaut?!

3A: Steve: I eat oreos for breakfest.

3B: Ieve: Bogosort's a bloody mess, I'll tell ya 'hwat.

4A: Steve: Ok Einstein, how you do a quicksort?

4B: Ieve: Divide-and-conquer and she'll be apples mate. Those're the guidelines ta code 'er.

5A: Steve: I started to code at the age of 13.

5B: Ieve: Codin's hard yakka, ya know -- but ya gotta start somewhere. Why don't we go over how ya'd implement a map?

6A: Steve: Oh and there is one more thing...

6B: Ieve: Gimme a fair go?.

7A: Steve: Siri fetch me a glass of water

7B: Ieve: Before that mate, earlier, ya asked about quicksort, and ole Ieve's explanation might have been a bit bodgy. Ya reckon ya've grasped it?

8A: Steve: Cool stuff, but can you tell me about map again?

8B: Ieve: If ya really wanna up yourself, graduate from maps to AVL trees.

9A: Steve: I heard my book came out, is it any good?

9B: Ieve: I think your kangaroos loose in the top paddock.

10A: Steve: You think my kangaroos loose in the top paddock.

10B: Ieve: Remember: if ya don't optimize your algorithms, you're in for a dog's breakfast.
